  abstract = {The Francevillian biota (Also referred to as Gabon macrofossils, Gabonionta or Francevillian group fossils) are a collection of 2.1-billion-year-old Palaeoproterozoic  macroscopic structures, controversially suggested to be fossils, known from the Francevillian B Formation in Gabon, a black shale province notable for its lack of any noticeable metamorphism. The structures have been postulated by some authors to be evidence of the earliest form of multicellular life, and of eukaryotes. They were discovered by an international team led by Moroccan-French geologist Abderrazak El Albani, of the University of Poitiers, France. While they have yet to be assigned to a formal taxonomic position, they have been informally and collectively referred to as the "Gabonionta", including by the Natural History Museum Vienna in 2014. The status of the structures as fossils has been questioned.},
